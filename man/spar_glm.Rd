\title{GLM Marginal \code{'sparmodel'}}
\usage{
spar_glm(..., control = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{includes arguments which can be passed as attributes to the
\code{'sparmodel'} object}

\item{control}{list of controls to be passed to the model function}
}
\value{
object of class \code{'sparmodel'} which is a list with elements
\itemize{
\item \code{name} (character)
\item \code{control} (list of controls passed as an argument)
\item \code{model_fun} function for estimating the model coefficients and the intercept.
This function should have arguments \code{y}, vector of standardized responses,
\code{z}, a matrix of projected predictors in each marginal model, and
\code{object}, which is a \code{'sparmodel'} object. Returns a list with
two elements: \code{gammas} which is the vector of regression coefficients
for the projected predictors and \code{intercept} which is the intercept of the model
}
}
