\arguments{
\item{name}{character}

\item{generate_fun}{function for generating the screening coefficient. This
function should have arguments  and   \code{y} (vector of responses -- standardized
for Gaussian family), \code{x} (the matrix of standardized predictors) and a
"\code{screencoef}" \code{object}.}

a function which in turn creates a function which in turn creates an

\description{
The created function will return a object of class "\code{screencoef}" which
constitutes of a list. The attributes of the generating object will include by
default \code{type}, which can take one of two values \code{"prob"} (indicating
probabilistic screening should be employed) or
\code{"fixed"} (indicating that the top \code{nscreen} variables should be employed).

Creates an object class screencoef using arguments passed by user.
