\usage{
\method{coef}{spar.cv}(object, opt_par = c("best", "1se"), nummod = NULL, nu = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{result of \link{spar.cv} function of class \code{'spar.cv'}.}

\item{opt_par}{one of \code{c("1se","best")}, chooses whether to select the
best pair of \code{nus} and \code{nummods} according to CV-Meas, or
the sparsest solution within one sd of that optimal CV-Meas;
ignored when \code{nummod} and \code{nu} are given}

\item{nummod}{optional number of models used to form coefficients}

\item{nu}{optional threshold level used to form coefficients}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods}
}
\value{
List with elements
\itemize{
\item \code{intercept} intercept value
\item \code{beta} vector of length p of averaged coefficients
\item \code{nummod} number of models based on which the coefficient is computed
\item \code{nu}  threshold based on which the coefficient is computed
}
